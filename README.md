Your Own Chess Code

This project holds the Microsoft Word documents which comprise ChessCode.  ChessCode is a step-by-step process for creating a state-of-the-art chess program in Microsoft Visual Studio, Community Edition.  Since ChessCode was designed to run on Intel 64-bit CPU's, it will not run on older 32-bit computers.  It uses intrinsic instructions so may not run on CPU's of other manufacturers.  It is written in C++.
