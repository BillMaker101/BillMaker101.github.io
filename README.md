 To hold GitHub Pages

This project holds the Microsoft Word documents which comprise ChessCode.  ChessCode is a step-by-step process for creating a state-of-the-art chess program in Microsoft Visual Studio, Community Edition.  Since ChessCode was designed to run on Intel 64-bit CPU's, it will not run on older 32-bit computers.  It uses intrinsic instructions so may not run on CPU's of other manufacturers.  It is written in C++.

The text in blue, "Improve this page", is an active link to the ChessCode files.  Run the mouse over it and you will see a link in the lower left of the window.  Click on it to access the files.  Once there, select the "<> Code" button.  You will see Releases on the right.  You can download the Initial Release (.zip or .tar.gz) file to obtain your copy.  Enjoy building your own chess game.
