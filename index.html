        This project holds the Microsoft Word documents which comprise ChessCode.  
        ChessCode is a step-by-step process for creating a state-of-the-art chess 
        program in Microsoft Visual Studio.  ChessCode 
        was designed to run on Intel 64-bit CPU's only.
        It uses Intel intrinsic instructions so may not run on other CPU's. 
        It is written in 'C' with a little 'C++'.
