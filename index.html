    <h1>Your Own Chess Code</h1>
    <p> - a step-by-step project from graphical user interface to state-of-the-art chess engine - </p>
    <p> - designed in 2025 by author of 1980's chess program 'Sfinks'</p>
    <p>
        This project holds the Microsoft Word documents which comprise ChessCode.  ChessCode is a
        step-by-step process for creating a state-of-the-art chess program in Microsoft Visual 
        Studio, Community Edition.  Since ChessCode was designed to run on Intel 64-bit CPU's, 
        it will not run on older 32-bit computers.  It uses intrinsic instructions so may not run 
        on CPU's of other manufacturers.  It is written in C++.

        The text in blue, "Improve this page", is an active link to the ChessCode files.  Run the
        mouse over it and you will see a link in the lower left of the window.  Click on it to 
        access the files.  Once there, select the "<> Code" button.  You will see Releases on the right.
        You can download the Initial Release (.zip or .tar.gz) file to obtain your copy.
